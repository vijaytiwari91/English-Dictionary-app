# English-Dictionary-app using python 
This project uses the skills learnt from week 1 to week 6. The aim of this project is to create an English Dictionary app that returns definitions of English words. When the application is started, it displays a menu as follows:

Main Menu

Add a new word
Find the meaning
Update a word
Exit

Enter Choice:

If item 1 is selected, it should prompt for a word and then accept its meaning. This pair of word and its meaning should be stored in a file called ‘words.txt’. When item 2 is selected, it should prompt for a word, search that word in the file ‘words.txt’ and return the meaning if it is found. If the meaning is not found, it should display an appropriate message. Similarly, when choice 3 is entered, it should accept a word and update its meaning. In all the above three cases, the prompt should return to the main menu. The words and their meanings should be stored as a dictionary in words.txt, using the concept of serialization. If choice 4 is selected, a graceful exit should be performed.
 
If you want to be recognized as a professional programmer, you have to practice more and develop applications in Python which you can include in your online portfolio. To achieve this, one such comprehensive project (with two small sub-projects inside it) is added which have to be completed by every student.

1A: English Dictionary App

This project uses the skills learnt from week 1 to week 6. The aim of this project is to create an English Dictionary app that returns definitions of English words.

1B: Library Book Management System

In this project, a Library Book Management System will be implemented with the front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite. It is a single window tkinter GUI application which will implement CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite. The window will contain text widgets to accept / display book title, author, year of publication, ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria.
